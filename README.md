# Lab 8 - Stoplight
## Part I - Tinkercad

- Visit https://www.tinkercad.com/
- Click Circuits > Create New Circuit
- Create a circuit to light up 3 light bulbs - *Remember each 3V coin battery is equivalent to a GPIO pin on your Raspberry Pi*
- Take a screenshot of your circuit

- [x] Take a screenshot of your circuit and upload it to this repository 
## Part II - Python3

- Redo part I with real components; however, for your power source, use GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi. _Turn off your Pi when connecting cables to the GPIO ports._
- Create a Python script `led_stoplight.py`  to recreate the following pattern out with your LEDs - Green for 5 seconds, then Yellow for 1 second,  Red for 4 seconds, then it repeats. _Do not use the stoplight sensor, use three individual LEDs._  
- You will need to import the `GPIO` and `time` libraries for this assignment.
- Add comments to your Python script to explain how it works.
- Take a short video of your stoplight working and a clear top-down photo of your wiring

- [x] Upload `led_stoplight.py`, the video, and the photo to this repository then continue to Part II

## Part III - RBG LED

- In a new script`rgb_stoplight.py`, repeat the previous two parts, this time using one 4 prong RGB LED, instead of 3 separate lights. This light should follow the same pattern switching from green, to yellow, to red.
- Add comments to your Python script to explain how it works.
- Take a clear top-down photo of your wiring

- [x] Upload `rgb_stoplight.py` and your photo then continue to Part IV
## Part IV - Starting with a Button

- In a new script `button_stoplight.py`, add a button or touch module to your project to start your RGB stoplight. When the button is pressed the light should light up in the green, yellow, red pattern.
- Take a short video of your button starting the stoplight and the pattern appearing correctly

- [x] Upload `button_stoplight.py`  and the video to this repository then continue to Part V - Wrap Up
## Part V - Wrap Up

- Make sure all the deliverables above are  uploaded to the repository
- Answer the following questions:

1. What is a Python library and how do you include one in your script?

A python library is an external file that provides extra functionality to a python script.
You can add one by typing import "name of the module" or from module import "package".

2. What does it mean for elements of a circuits to be in series vs. in parallel?

When a ciruit is a series, all the elements are connected in one loop. When a 
circuit is parallel, all the elements are in their own loop and connected to the same power source. If a failure were to occur, it would not break the entire loop.

3. Can you create a circuit of 3 light bulbs in series? Why or why not?

Yes because the current would just run through all of them in one loop.
